0.5
----

*Release date: Wed Jul 11 16:31:06 CEST 2012*

* XML signing and validation using http://pypi.python.org/pypi/dm.xmlsec.binding (requires M2Crypto at present)

Because of the way OpenSSL handles self-signed certificates the XML validation extracts
the public key from the certificate and uses that instead of the X509 certificate to 
validate an XML signature. Right now this introduces a dependency on M2Crypto which will
be removed in the fugure. Note that ubuntu/debian users should install python-m2crypto
instead of installing M2Crypto (http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=637904)

*Release date: Thu Aug 30 08:00:00 CEST 2012*

* XML signing and validation using pyXMLSecurity
* Support for PKCS#11-based HSMs using pykcs11

We are now using a (limited) pure-python implmementation of xmlsec which makes it easier
to sign using HSMs. The only mandatory non-python dependency now is lxml.
