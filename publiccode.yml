    shortDescription: "pyFF is a simple but reasonably complete SAML metadata
      processor capable of  aggregate, validate, combine, transform, sign or
      publish SAML metadata. "
    longDescription: >-
      pyFF is a simple but reasonably complete SAML metadata processor. It is
      intended to be used by anyone who needs to aggregate, validate, combine,
      transform, sign or publish SAML metadata.


      pyFF is used to run infrastructure for several identity federations of
      signifficant size including edugain.org.


      pyFF supports producing and validating digital signatures on SAML metadata
      using the pyXMLSecurity package which in turn supports PKCS#11 and other
      mechanisms for talking to HSMs and other cryptographic hardware.


      pyFF is also a complete implementation of the SAML metadata query protocol
      as described in draft-young-md-query and draft-young-md-query-saml and
      implements extensions to MDQ for searching which means pyFF can be used as
      the backend for a discovery service for large-scale identity federations.


      Possible usecases include running an federation aggregator, filtering
      metadata for use by a discovery service, generating reports from metadata
      (eg certificate expiration reports), transforming metadata to add custom
      elements.
